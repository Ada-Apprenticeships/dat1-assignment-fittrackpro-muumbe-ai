# 📝 Fittrack Pro Database Assignment

This README will guide you through the assignment for the Fittrack Pro business

## Assignment Overview

This assignment consists for one part broken into multiple steps

You are tasked with initializating and creating queries for a database to allow for deployment in the future.

FitTrack Pro is a comprehensive database management system designed for our chain of fitness centers. This project is crucial for managing our operations efficiently and providing insights into our business performance.

** SQL Query Development **
- Create SQL commands to setup the database tables
- Import precursor data into database
- Write SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate data according to the business requirements
- Test the SQL queries

## ⚙️ Check your installation

We recommend using a [GitHub Codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview) as your development environment for this project. If you create a Codespace using this repository it should automatically install the core applications and dependencies you need to get started with this assignment. However you should check that you have the correct software installed in your codespace before starting the assignment.

1. Check you have `sqlite3` installed in your project:

```terminal
sqlite3 --version
```

2. Check you have node installed in your project:

```terminal
node -v
```

## 🏗️ SQL query development

You will focus on writing SQL queries to set up the database tables, insert sample data and retrieve data according to the query requirements.

Once you've created your tables, you'll need to run this and create some data to add into your database to check that your tables are defined correctly.

### Database Import

The team has provided us with some initial data alongside creating our own data entries to help test the new database, when the schema is ready they have setup a script to import this new data over, this should be done on a blank database (tables only, no data)

```shell
npm run import
```

You can then add any other test inserts as you like

## 🔍 Checking your SQL queries

`sqlite3` has a CLI (command line interface) which we can use to interact with our Sqlite databases. You can check your SQL queries by running your `.sql` files with the `sqlite3` CLI.

| ℹ️ Double check you have `sqlite3` installed in your codespace. Open a terminal and run `sqlite3 --version` to check you get the sqlite3 version in the command output.

To run any `.sql` file with `sqlite3`, you can:

1. Ensure your `.sql` file opens a database using the `.open` statement.
2. Open a terminal and use the `sqlite3` command-line tool from the root directory:
   ```sh
   sqlite3 <name-of-database>.db < <path-to-file>.sql
   ```
3. Check the query output when you run the command.

For example, to run the file `schema.sql` located in the `src` directory, you can:

1. Open a terminal and run the following command from the root directory:

```sh
sqlite3 fittrackpro.db < src/schema.sql
```
2. Check the query output when you run the command
